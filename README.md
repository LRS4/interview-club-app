# Interview Club App

## About

The first rule of Interview Club is that you don't talk about interview club! This app is a sharing platform where questions and answers to interview questions can be posted, answered, rated and searched for. It will be a simple CRUD application that uses React as the frontend with MongoDB and Express for the backend server and APIs.

## Build

The application will be built using the MERN stack - this interested me as I wanted to learn more about NoSQL databases and also React for front-end development.

* MongoDB
* Express

* Nodejs

## Running the application

npm install

```
