# Interview Club App

## About

The first rule of Interview Club is that you don't talk about interview club! This app is a sharing platform where questions and answers to interview questions can be posted, answered, rated and searched for. It will be a simple CRUD application aimed at delivering this sole objective.

## Build

The application will be built using the MERN stack - this interested me as I wanted to learn more about NoSQL databases and also React for front-end development. To start client use npm start and to start server use node index.js.

* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Nodejs
* GraphQL

## Installation

Install packages
```
npm install
```

Run GraphQl server
```
cd server
