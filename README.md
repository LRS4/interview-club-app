# Interview Club App

## About

The first rule of Interview Club is that you don't talk about interview club! This app is a sharing platform where questions and answers to interview questions can be posted. It will be a simple application that serves this single purpose. 

## Build

The application will be built using the MERN stack - this interested me as I wanted to learn more about NoSQL databases and also React for front-end development.

* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Nodejs
* GraphQL

## Notes

* C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongo.exe
